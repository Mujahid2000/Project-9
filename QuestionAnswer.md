1. Answer: A: {}
explanation: 
In the first numbered line of code, a variable named greeting is given but no value is given. A variable named greeting is declared with the empty object in the second numbered line. In the third number line, the console is instructed to show the value of the variable.

2. Answer: C: "12"
Explanation: Here value 1 of a is a number and value 2 of b is a string. We know that numbers and strings in JavaScript sit side by side when sum together. So the correct answer is 12.

3. Answer: A: ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']
Explanation: In this code, I first create an array that stores four food emojis, defining the array as "food". Then, an object "data" is created, which will have a property "favoriteFood", which is initially the value of the first element of "food" that contains "🍕". Later we tried assigning "🍝" to the "info.favoriteFood" property, but that didn't affect the basic "food" array, so when we log "food" we see ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑" , "🍔"].

4. Answer: B: Hi there, undefined
Explanation: In the code in the question, there is a function that takes "name" as a parameter. However, when I want to call that function and see the result with console.log I don't provide any name. This time, the "name" variable inside the function is empty ie becomes "undefined". Then the function returns the result in a string format, which is "Hi there, undefined".

5. Answer: C: 3
Explanation: In the code given in the question, first create a variable count and set it to 0 and create an array nums which contains four numbers. Next, step through each element of the nums array using the forEach method. In the callback function, there is an if (num) condition that checks for each element whether the current element is true (That is, not 0). If the element is true, then I add one to the count variable. Because the nums array has three true elements (1, 2, and 3), the count value is 3, and that is what is logged to the console.
